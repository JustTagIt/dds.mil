     Code.mil is an experiment in open source at the U.S. Department of Defense in cooperation with <a href="https://www.code.gov">Code.gov</a>. The goal is to foster open collaboration with the developer community around the world on DoD open source projects. During the first phase, which launched in early 2017, the Defense Digital Service wrote a strategy for open sourcing code written by DoD employees and <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1092364/dod-announces-the-launch-of-codemil-an-experiment-in-open-source/">called upon</a> the F/OSS developer community to help us finalize that plan.

     Built in collaboration with military familes, <a href="https://www.move.mil">Move.mil</a> is the first stop for service members, their families and Department of Defense Civilians to plan their next Permanent Change of Station, Retirement, or Separation move.  The site was completely overhauled by the Air Force Digital Service with the goal of providing key information to customers throughout each phase of their move.

With the largest payout in any government bug bounty program to date, Hack The Air Force 2.0 awarded $125,000 in bounties for 110 vulnerabilities discovered.  Open to hackers from 32 countries, this competition continues our work on broadening the community of hackers paid by DoD to find new vulnerabilities while building upon our partnership with Twenty-Fourth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber).

     As part of work on the MEPCOM Integrated Resource System (MIRS), the technical system that underpins the "accessions" process by which recruits are sworn into the military, the Defense Digital Service setup electronic records transfer between the MEPCOM systems and the Army, Navy, and Air Force human resources systems.  This freed recruits from having to carry frequently lost paperwork from the accessions station to boot camp --- as well as keeping staff from having to re-enter the data by hand!  Since launch in late 2017, this system has saved over 1.5 million pages of paper from being carried back and forth.

     The Defense Digital Service launched a pilot program to help engage and support technical talent within the U.S. Army Cyber Command. Through a series of collaborative pilot projects, highly-trained army officers and soldiers work side-by-side with DDS civilians in unclassified, collaborative, startup-like spaces. Teams tackle real-world problems using technology and tools found in the private sector. Examples of projects include <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-dream-team-tech-savvy-soldiers/">developing drone detection technologies</a> for critical missions, hunting adversaries on DoD networks, and <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/defense-digital-service-redesigns-army-cyber-command-training/">redesigning training for cyber soldiers</a>.
