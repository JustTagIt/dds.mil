      <h2>Solving big problems, supporting critical missions.</h2>
      <p>The Defense Digital Service (DDS) is an agency team of the <a href="https://www.usds.gov">U.S. Digital Service</a>. We hire top technologists on term-limited "tours of duty" to help build better services and solutions. Our mission is to drive a giant leap forward in the way the Department builds, buys and deploys technology and digital services.</p>

      <h2>Our work</h2>

We use design and technology to improve government services, strengthen national defense, and care for military members and their families. Explore some of our projects below.</p>
