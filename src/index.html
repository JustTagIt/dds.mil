        The Defense Digital Service (DDS) is an agency team of the <a href="https://www.usds.gov">U.S. Digital Service</a>. We use design and technology to improve government services and support national defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Department of Defense defends and protects our nation's military and civilians across the globe. However, oftentimes progress may be hindered by outdated systems and technology. We hire top technologists for short-term "tours of civic duty" to work alongside civil servants and service members to transform technology across the Department.
