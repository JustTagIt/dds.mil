        The Department of Defense defends and protects our nation's military and civilians across the globe. However, oftentimes progress may be hindered by outdated systems and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to drive a giant leap forward in the way the agency builds, buys and deploys technology and digital services. We hire top technologists for short-term "tours of civic duty" to work alongside civil servants and service members building better tools to strengthen national security and care for military members and their families.
